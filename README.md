# PROJECT : Highest Grossing Movies
Data Processing in Python - JEM207

### MOTIVATION
This analysis is based on finding common characteristics among the most profitable films of all time, in order to obtain insights to consider. The purpose is not to extrapolate information in order to determine the revenue that a movie can collect, but rather to take into account what these movies share, so that movie studios can be more willing to produce some before others and also issues related to their release.
